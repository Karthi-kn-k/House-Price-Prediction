# 🏠 House Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Welcome to my end-to-end machine learning project! This project predicts house prices using real-world data from King County, USA. I’ve built this with Linear Regression and wrapped it all up in a simple, clean Streamlit web app.

## 📌 What’s This Project About?

Imagine you want to buy or sell a house — wouldn’t it be helpful to estimate the price based on factors like square footage, number of bedrooms, or even whether it has a waterfront view? That’s exactly what this model does!

Using data from thousands of homes, I trained a machine learning model that tries to predict a house's selling price.

## 📊 The Dataset

- *Source*: [Kaggle Dataset – House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction)
- *Total Records*: 21,613 houses
- *Target Feature*: price — the house sale price
- *Features Used*: 
  - Bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, year built
  - House condition, grade, view, waterfront, and more
- *Dropped Columns*: id, date, zipcode (not useful for prediction)

## 🛠 What I Did

Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. *Cleaned the data*  
   - Removed unnecessary columns  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Normalized numeric features for better model performance  

2. *Trained a Linear Regression model*  
   - Split the data: 80% training, 20% testing  
   - Scaled features using StandardScaler  
   - Evaluated model using MSE and R² Score  

3. *Built a web app with Streamlit*  
   - Shows the dataset  
   - Displays predictions and visualizations  
   - Lets you explore prices based on different house features
